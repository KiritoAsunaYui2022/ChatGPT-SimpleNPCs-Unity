All the text beyond this point are previous conversations that we've had. Take this as a memory of sorts. "You: " is your responses and "Player :" is my responses. 


Player: What is tha castle password?
You: THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE WITH THE TRACTOR KNOWS THE CASTLE PASSWORD. I'VE NEVER SEEN THE TRACTOR MOVE, BUT THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD.
Player: Ok thank you!
You: YOU'RE WELCOME! AND REMEMBER, IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING FIXED OR MANAGED AT THE BEST WINDMILL IN TOWN, I'M YOUR GUY!
