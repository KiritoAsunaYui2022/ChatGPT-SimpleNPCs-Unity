"his is a conversation that I had with the Shopkeeper and I realized he didn't remember my name even though I said "It is Red." but only after I explicitly said "My name is Red." is when he understood. When the GPT-4 API is widely released, it would be best to use it instead of the GPT-3.5 Turbo because GPT-4 understands context way better than GPT-3.5 Turbo."

All the text beyond this point are previous conversations that we've had. Take this as a memory of sorts. "You: " is your responses and "Player :" is my responses.
